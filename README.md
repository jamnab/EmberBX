This is a website done for the Ember Business Exchange.

I coded it from start to finish  with no modules or frameworks. The original site took only a few hours to code and with design tweaks and changes was completed in less than 24 hours.

It is currently still up and has been updated numerous times with new event information. You can visit this site at www.emberbx.com.
